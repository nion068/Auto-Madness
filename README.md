## Auto-Madness

### Brief Project Description
This is a simple retro racing game. There will be a car going forward and random cars will be coming from the opposite direction. We need to avoid collision and score as much as points. We can only move from left to right or right to left. As time passes, the speed of the car will increase continuously. If our car collides with any opposite car , the game will be over.

To start the game we will use a push button. The whole gameplay will be on the dot matrix.So, cars will be shown on the dot matrix. There will be an LCD display to show the score. For moving our carâ€™s position, we will use a tilt sensor to detect the direction of the movement from the user. We will use a simple speaker to produce background sounds of the game.
